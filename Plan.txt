The Network of Terms in Voltaire's Phylosophical Dictionary

Starting text: "Voltaire_PhilosophicalDictionary.txt"
Uncleaned text: "Voltaire_PhilosophicalDictionary_Full.txt"

Jupyter Notebook 1

Instructions:

1. Create first list (list of terms): Open "Voltaire_PhilosophicalDictionary.txt" in Sublime and search for "_". Copy the string between _'s and put it quoted in a list called terms. Forget about patterns inside the text! Get only starting patterns which are capitalized:

_XXXXXXXXX_

terms=["ADULTERY", "ADVOCATE", "ANCIENTS AND MODERNS", ]

2. Next create a list of references: The first in each parenthsis in the lis is the referencing term and the second is the referenced term (both need to be included in the list of terms):

references=[
("LOCAL CRIMES","ADULTERY"),
("ADULTERY","ADVOCATE"),
("EZOURVEIDAM","LIBRARY"),
